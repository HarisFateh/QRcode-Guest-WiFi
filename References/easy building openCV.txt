# Easy install OpenCV for python on Mac, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi

#### Get pip from bootstarp site: 
- wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

#### Now to install pip for Python 3 enter:
- sudo python3 get-pip.py

#### Next, and for the Raspberry Pi only, we need to install some additional packages:
- sudo apt-get update

#### Now install the prerequisites:
- sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev
- sudo apt-get install libqtwebkit4 libqt4-test
- sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libjasper-dev libqtgui4 python3-pyqt5

#### Finally, we can enter a wonderfully simple command to install opencv:
- sudo pip install opencv-contrib-python

#### For those of you also used to installing OpenCV manually I am sure you will be as happy as I am!:
- import cv2
- cv2.__version__
